                            We fought until the sun rose<br>
                            And I still ain't been to bed (Bed, bed)<br>
                            And while you got your eyes closed<br>
                            The devil wakes up in my head (Head, head)<br>
                            He told me that you hate me and you blame me<br>
                            And you said that you wish that you were dead<br>
                            So I write a little note out<br>
                            Suicidal love roulette<br>
                            <br><span>[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]</span><br>
                            You make me wanna jump off the roof<br>
                            'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool<br>
                            I'd rather a coffin, handmade for two<br>
                            'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool<br>
                            Just like a fool<br>
                            Just like a fool<br>

                            I walk up to the edge, yeah<br>
                            And say a prayer before I let go (Let go, let go)<br>
                            I'll probably see you through the window<br>
                            While I'm falling past the fifth floor (Fifth floor, fifth floor)<br>
                            Then you get there just in time to save me and apologize<br>
                            And maybe we can go back to bed<br>
                            But you run past me instead<br>
                            And hit the ground before I can<br>
                            <br><span>[Chorus: Jessie Reyez]</span><br>
                            I had to watch ya jump from the roof<br>
                            Boy, I love you to death, just like a fool<br>
                            We'll need a coffin, handmade for two<br>
                            'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool<br>
                            Just like a fool, uh<br>

                            We reincarnate every time<br>
                            And I'll find you in another life<br>

                            I don't really wanna fight (Nah)<br>
                            I just wanna spend the night (Yeah)<br>
                            But I don't wanna spend the night<br>
                            Actin' out "Love the Way You Lie"<br>
                            But the shit just went awry<br>
                            Hit me in the eye, bit me in the thigh, then begin to cry<br>
                            I'm at the end of my wits, let's end this, ma (It's over)<br>
                            Then begin again tomorrow<br>
                            Fresh start, let you spoil me<br>
                            Pledge your loyalty, treat me like a king<br>
                            Just to fuck me over royally<br>
                            Boy, are we water mixed with oil
                            See another shouting match,<br>
                            'bout to have it out<br>
                            But no matter how mad I get, I'm so mad about you<br>
                            Forgot what I was even mad about<br>
                            I know we've had our challenges still<br>
                            I keep trying to salvage it, you<br>
                            Wanna sabotage it, I'm down to the hill<br>
                            But you think I'm fucking around on you, chill<br>
                            It never changes, I doubt if it will<br>
                            Cheat on me, then say "How does it feel?"<br>
                            I feel like blowing my fucking head off<br>
                            After I write you out of my will<br>
                            Bitch, how could you?<br>
                            Almost had a child wit' you<br>
                            Woulda settled down wit' you<br>
                            Now I'll put you in the ground and bury myself wit' you<br>
                            I don't get you, it's as if you're drowning<br>
                            I stick my hand out, but you fool me<br>
                            You're just trying to pull me down wit' you (Down wit' you)<br>
                            Thought it was you my world revolve around<br>
                            I should aim a revolver round at you<br>
                            180 proof, guess I'm making my way to the roof<br>
                            You're a traitor, I say that we're through<br>
                            You hop in the elevator, then you<br>
                            Say the coffin, they better make it for two<br>
                            'Cause if you jump, I'm jumpin' with you<br>
                            And neither one of us have nothing to lose but each other<br>
                            We're just a couple of fools<br>
