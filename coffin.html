                            <span>We fought until the sun rose<br></span>
                            <span>And I still ain't been to bed (Bed, bed)<br></span>
                            <span>And while you got your eyes closed<br></span>
                            <span>The devil wakes up in my head (Head, head)<br></span>
                            <span>He told me that you hate me and you blame me<br></span>
                            <span>And you said that you wish that you were dead<br></span>
                            <span>So I write a little note out<br></span>
                            <span>Suicidal love roulette<br></span>

                            <span>'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool<br></span>
                            <span>I'd rather a coffin, handmade for two<br></span>
                            <span>'Cause I love you to death, just like a fool<br></span>
                            <span>Just like a fool<br></span>

                            <span>And say a prayer before I let go (Let go, let go)<br></span>
                            <span>I'll probably see you through the window<br></span>
                            <span>While I'm falling past the fifth floor (Fifth floor, fifth floor)<br></span>
                            <span>Then you get there just in time to save me and apologize<br></span>
                            <span>And maybe we can go back to bed<br></span>
                            <span>But you run past me instead<br></span>
                            <span>And hit the ground before I can<br></span>

                            <span>We'll need a coffin, handmade for two<br></span>

                            <span>We reincarnate every time<br></span>
                            <span>And I'll find you in another life<br></span>

                            <span>I don't really wanna fight (Nah)<br></span>
                            <span>I just wanna spend the night (Yeah)<br></span>
                            <span>But I don't wanna spend the night<br></span>
                            <span>Actin' out "Love the Way You Lie"<br></span>
                            <span>But the shit just went awry<br></span>
                            <span>Hit me in the eye, bit me in the thigh, then begin to cry<br></span>
                            <span>I'm at the end of my wits, let's end this, ma (It's over)<br></span>
                            <span>Then begin again tomorrow<br></span>
                            <span>Fresh start, let you spoil me<br></span>
                            <span>Pledge your loyalty, treat me like a king<br></span>
                            <span>Just to fuck me over royally<br></span>
                            <span>Boy, are we water mixed with oil<br></span>
                            <span>See another shouting match,<br></span>
                            <span>'bout to have it out<br></span>
                            <span>But no matter how mad I get, I'm so mad about you<br></span>
                            <span>Forgot what I was even mad about<br></span>
                            <span>I know we've had our challenges still<br></span>
                            <span>I keep trying to salvage it, you<br></span>
                            <span>Wanna sabotage it, I'm down to the hill<br></span>
                            <span>But you think I'm fucking around on you, chill<br></span>
                            <span>It never changes, I doubt if it will<br></span>
                            <span>Cheat on me, then say "How does it feel?"<br></span>
                            <span>I feel like blowing my fucking head off<br></span>
                            <span>After I write you out of my will<br></span>
                            <span>Bitch, how could you?<br></span>
                            <span>Almost had a child wit' you<br></span>
                            <span>Woulda settled down wit' you<br></span>
                            <span>Now I'll put you in the ground and bury myself wit' you<br></span>
                            <span>I don't get you, it's as if you're drowning<br></span>
                            <span>I stick my hand out, but you fool me<br></span>
                            <span>You're just trying to pull me down wit' you (Down wit' you)<br></span>
                            <span>Thought it was you my world revolve around<br></span>
                            <span>I should aim a revolver round at you<br></span>
                            <span>180 proof, guess I'm making my way to the roof<br></span>
                            <span>You're a traitor, I say that we're through<br></span>
                            <span>You hop in the elevator, then you<br></span>
                            <span>Say the coffin, they better make it for two<br></span>
                            <span>'Cause if you jump, I'm jumpin' with you<br></span>
                            <span>And neither one of us have nothing to lose but each other<br></span>
                            <span>We're just a couple of fools<br></span>
