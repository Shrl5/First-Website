                            <span>Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity <br></span>
                            <span>To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment<br></span>
                            <span>Would you capture it or just let it slip?<br><br></span>
                            <span class="versis">[Verse 1]</span><br>
                            <span>Yo<br></span>
                            <span>His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br></span>
                            <span>There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br></span>
                            <span>He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready<br></span>
                            <span>To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting<br></span>
                            <span>What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br></span>
                            <span>He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br></span>
                            <span>He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now<br></span>
                            <span>The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow<br></span>
                            <span>Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity<br></span>
                            <span>Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad<br></span>
                            <span>But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it<br></span>
                            <span>He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter<br></span>
                            <span>He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant<br></span>
                            <span>He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br></span>
                            <span>Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody<br></span>
                            <span>Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br><br></span>
                            <span class="versis">[Chorus]</span><br>
                            <span>You better lose yourself in the music<br></span>
                            <span>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br></span>
                            <span>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br></span>
                            <span>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br></span>
                            <span>You better lose yourself in the music<br></span>
                            <span>The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br></span>
                            <span>You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br></span>
                            <span>This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br></span>
                            <span>You better<br></span>

                            <span>His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping<br></span>
                            <span>This world is mine for the taking, make me king<br></span>
                            <span>As we move toward a new world order<br></span>
                            <span>A normal life is boring, but superstardom's<br></span>
                            <span>Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<br></span>
                            <span>Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br></span>
                            <span>These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br></span>
                            <span>He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br></span>
                            <span>God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br></span>
                            <span>He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br></span>
                            <span>But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water<br></span>
                            <span>These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br></span>
                            <span>They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br></span>
                            <span>He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br></span>
                            <span>Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br></span>
                            <span>But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah<br><br></span>
                            <span class="versis">[Chorus]</span><br>

                            <span>No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br></span>
                            <span>Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br></span>
                            <span>I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed<br></span>
                            <span>I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br></span>
                            <span>But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br></span>
                            <span>Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br></span>
                            <span>All the pain inside amplified by the<br></span>
                            <span>Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-<br></span>
                            <span>Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br></span>
                            <span>'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br></span>
                            <span>And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br></span>
                            <span>And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder<br></span>
                            <span>Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br></span>
                            <span>Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna<br></span>
                            <span>Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br></span>
                            <span>Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me<br></span>
                            <span>To the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br></span>
                            <span>To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br></span>
                            <span>Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br></span>
                            <span>Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got<br></span>
                            <span>To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br></span>
                            <span>So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not<br></span>
                            <span>This may be the only opportunity that I got<br><br></span>
