                            Look, if you had one shot or one opportunity <br>
                            To seize everything you ever wanted in one moment<br>
                            Would you capture it or just let it slip?<br>
                            Yo<br>
                            <span>[Verse 1]</span><br>
                            His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy<br>
                            There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti<br>
                            He's nervous, but on the surface, he looks calm and ready<br>
                            To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting<br>
                            What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud<br>
                            He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out<br>
                            He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now<br>
                            The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow<br>
                            Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity<br>
                            Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad<br>
                            But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it<br>
                            He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter<br>
                            He's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant<br>
                            He knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's<br>
                            Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody<br>
                            Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him<br><br>
                            <span>[Chorus]</span><br>
                            You better lose yourself in the music<br>
                            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
                            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                            You better lose yourself in the music<br>
                            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
                            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                            You better<br>
                            <span>[Verse 2]</span><br>
                            His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping<br>
                            This world is mine for the taking, make me king<br>
                            As we move toward a new world order<br>
                            A normal life is boring, but superstardom's<br>
                            Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder<br>
                            Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over<br>
                            These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows<br>
                            He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads<br>
                            God only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father<br>
                            He goes home and barely knows his own daughter<br>
                            But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water<br>
                            These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product<br>
                            They moved on to the next schmoe who flows<br>
                            He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera<br>
                            Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner<br>
                            But the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah<br><br>
                            <span>[Chorus]</span><br>
                            You better lose yourself in the music<br>
                            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
                            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                            You better lose yourself in the music<br>
                            The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)<br>
                            You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow<br>
                            This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo<br>
                            You better<br>
                            <span>[Verse 3]</span><br>
                            No more games, I'ma change what you call rage<br>
                            Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged<br>
                            I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed<br>
                            I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage<br>
                            But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher<br>
                            Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper<br>
                            All the pain inside amplified by the<br>
                            Fact that I can't get by with my nine-to-<br>
                            Five and I can't provide the right type of life for my family<br>
                            'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers<br>
                            And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life<br>
                            And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder<br>
                            Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter<br>
                            Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna<br>
                            Baby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna<br>
                            Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me<br>
                            To the point I'm like a snail, I've got<br>
                            To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot<br>
                            Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not<br>
                            Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got<br>
                            To go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot<br>
                            So here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not<br>
                            This may be the only opportunity that I got<br><br>
                            <span>[Chorus]</span><br>
